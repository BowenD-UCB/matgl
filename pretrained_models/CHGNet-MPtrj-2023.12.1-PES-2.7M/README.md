# Description

This model is a CHGNet universal potential trained from the Materials Project trajectory (MPtrj) dataset
that contains over 1.5 million structures with 89 elements.
This Matgl implementation has slight modification from original pytorch implementation by adding directed edge updates.

# Training dataset
